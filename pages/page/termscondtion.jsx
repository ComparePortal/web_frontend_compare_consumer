This means that our processing of personal data is limited to what is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the personal data was collected. For example, we delete user accounts that have been inactive for 18 months.</p>
         <p>When the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were originally collected, we anonymise or delete them.</p>
         <h3 id="your-rights">Your rights</h3>

            <li>Right to correction</li>

         <p>Upon a request to have your personal data deleted from us, we will anonymise your posts, reviews, and your user account. This means that your reviews or posts published on the Services will remain if they don&#39;t contain personal data, though with an anonymous user ID as the sender. The main reason why we don&#39;t delete reviews or posts is that these are an important part of yashra.in. Without them, yashra.in would lose an important part of its purpose. If you want to delete your reviews or posts in the Services, you have to do this before requesting a deletion of your personal data from us.</p>
         <h3 id="security">Security</h3>
         <p>We maintain routines and measures to ensure that no unauthorised persons gain access to your personal data and that all processing of personal data takes place in accordance with applicable law. These measures include risk assessments, implementation of organisational and physical measures, as well as routines for handling of data and follow up requests regarding access to, rectification, block and deletion of personal data.</p>
         <h3 id="use-of-cookies-and-other-technologies">Use of cookies and other technologies</h3>
         <p>We use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies to understand you as a user and to analyse data regarding users. You can find more information about our use of these technologies in our <a href="">cookie policy</a>.</p>
         <h3 id="use-of-social-plug-ins">Use of social plug-ins</h3>
         <p>When you use the Services, you may share information from the Services on social media, such as Facebook,
            LinkedIn, or Twitter, through an implemented social plug-in (such as a &#39;like&#39; button). If you choose 
            to share information via a social plug-in, your browser will transfer the following data to the social medium:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li> date and time of your visit;</li>
            <li> the internet address or URL for the address you are temporarily visiting;</li>
            <li> your IP address;</li>
            <li> the browser you are using;</li>
            <li> the operating system you are using;</li>
            <li>  your username and password and, where applicable, whether you are a registered user of the social medium, your first name and surname; and</li>
            <li>  the information for which you have used this specific plug-in.</li>
         </ul>
         <p> yashra.in is not the personal data controller for the processing of personal data that happens after you share information via social plug-ins on the Services. The personal data responsibility lies with the social media that provide these plug-ins. For this reason, we refer to the respective social medium if you want to read more about the processing of personal data within the framework of the social plug-ins that we use. Please note that you can block social plug-ins in your browser settings.</p>
